I am an Australian programmer / network engineer currently doing contract work
for a Melbourne based encrypted storage company.

I also run [User Space](https://userspace.com.au), an Australian based
programming and custom hosting business.

Over the past 20 years I have had the oportunity to design and deploy large
distributed server and web applications, IPv6 networks, massive database
clusters and client side encryption software in a variety of languages.

I reside in Melbourne, Australia (and sometimes northern Thailand) with my
wife, son and daughter.
