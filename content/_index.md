title: About me
---

I am an Australian with a broad range of experience as a
software engineer and analyst, both in Australia and South East
Asia.  I also run [UserSpace](https://userspace.com.au), a
Melbourne based programming and bespoke hosting business.

Over the past 2 decades I have had been involved in the design
and development of large distributed applications, complex
networks spanning multiple continents, resilient database clusters
and custom encryption software in a variety of languages and
environments.

I prefer working remotely and have done so for the last 10
years from the major cities of Australia's east coast, the deserts
of Western Australia and now both the north and south of
Thailand.

I call Melbourne, Australia my home with my wife, son and
daughter.

I am available for hire, [contact me](/contact/) or read [my
résumé/CV](http://src.userspace.com.au/felix/resume/plain/felix_hanley.pdf).
