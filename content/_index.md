title: About me
---

![Photo of the protagonist, Felix](/img/profile.jpg) I am an Australian based
Software Engineer. I also run [UserSpace](https://userspace.com.au), a business
providing bespoke programming and hosting solutions to local and international
clients.

I have worked on distributed systems, network security, applied cryptography,
document and stream processing engines, and more, in a variety of languages and
environments.

I prefer working remotely and have done so for over 10 years from around
Australia and South East Asia.

I am usually available for hire, [contact me](/contact/) or read [my
résumé](/work/).
