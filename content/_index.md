title: About me
---

I am an Australian based Software Engineer. I also run
[UserSpace](https://userspace.com.au), a business providing bespoke programming
and hosting solutions to local and international clients.

Over the past 2 decades I have had been involved in the design and development
of large distributed applications, complex networks spanning multiple
continents, resilient database clusters and custom encryption software in a
variety of languages and environments.

I prefer working remotely and have done so for the last 10 years from the major
cities of Australia's east coast, the deserts of Western Australia and now both
the north and south of Thailand.

I call Melbourne, Australia my home with my wife, son and daughter.

I am available for hire, [contact me](/contact/) or read [my
résumé](/felix_hanley.pdf).
