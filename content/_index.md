title: About me
---

I am an Australian based Software Engineer. I also run
[UserSpace](https://userspace.com.au), a business providing bespoke programming
and hosting solutions to local and international clients.

I have worked on distributed systems, network security, applied cryptography,
document and stream processing engines, and more, in a variety of languages and
environments.

I prefer working remotely and have done so for over 10 years from around
Australia and South East Asia. I live in Melbourne, Australia with my
wife, son and daughter.

I am available for hire, [contact me](/contact/) or read [my
résumé](/work/).
