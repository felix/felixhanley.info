title: Hello, I'm Felix Hanley
---

![Photo of the protagonist, Felix](/img/profile.jpg) I am an Australian based
software engineer & architect.

My interests are in distributed systems, applied cryptography, and measuring
everything.  I am currently employed in the observability space, and am
involved in the development of [ISO
20248](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_20248) for small (bit size)
digital signatures.

I run [UserSpace](https://userspace.com.au) which provides bespoke programming
and hosting solutions.

I am sometimes available for hire, [contact me](/contact/) or read [my
résumé](/work/).
