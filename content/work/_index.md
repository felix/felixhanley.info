I am a software engineer with many years experience in both small and large
teams producing software and system in a variety of industries. My experience
covers data processing, encryption, security, devops and general consulting.

My wife and I moved to Thailand in 2006 and have spent nearly 10 years as
part-time volunteers in SE Asia with our two children. During this time I
worked remotely for Australian and international companies.

I am an Australian citizen, a native English speaker, and am also fluent in
Thai. I am available for full-time, part-time, contract and remote positions.
