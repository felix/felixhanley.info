I am a software engineer with many years experience producing software and
systems in a variety of industries. My experience covers ETL pipelines, PKI &
client side encryption, network security, API & micro-service design, large
scale hosting and general consulting.

As an Australian I am a native English speaker but I am also fluent in Thai. I
am available for full-time, part-time, and contract positions with remote work
being preferred.
