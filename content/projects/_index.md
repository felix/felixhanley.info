Projects that I am actively working on or have contributed to. You may find
others on [my personal Git hosting](https://src.userspace.com.au) and
[GitHub](https://github.com/felix/).

## Personal projects

[Lahu language resources](http://lahu.felixhanley.info)
: Lahu language project page. A collection of information about the language
spoken by the Lahu hill tribe group.

[dm](http://src.userspace.com.au/dm/about/)
: A single-file "dotfile" manager written in POSIX shell. It creates and
synchronises symlinks in your home directory to a central dotfile source.

[Family tree](http://genealogy.felixhanley.info/)
: My family tree. Most work has been done by my mother.

[BitArray](https://src.userspace.com.au/bitarray/about/)
: A bit array structure with sub-byte methods like packing and shifting for
arrays of arbitrary length

[Encoding converter](/projects/encoding-converter/)
: Convert between HEX, Base64, ASCII or binary, from and to files.

[tinydnsdyn](https://src.userspace.com.au/tinydnsdyn/about/)
: This is a basic dynamic client and server for the djbdns DNS server 'tinydns'
by Dan Bernstein. Not maintained.

[timetrackr](https://src.userspace.com.au/timetrackr/about/)
: A simple CLI time tracking utility. Not maintained.

## Open Source Contributions

[asn1.js](https://github.com/felix/asn1.js)
: A very useful project for working with ASN.1 and encryption primitives with
Javascript. This project was chosen over others due to its good handling of
implicit types and encapsulated models. It also has a nice DSL.

[FreeBSD Ports](https://github.com/felix/freebsd-ports)
: Mainly contributions for Nuster, Postgresql and MariaDB Galera clustering
support for client work.

[Void Linux](https://github.com/felix/void-packages)
: As Linux distributions go this one is very similar to the BSD method of building
ports and it is not ham-strung by systemd. I use Void where BSD is not supported by
hardware.
