I have been learning Lahu since 2008 with some limited success. Lahu is a
language spoken by the Lahu people in Northern Thailand, Burma, China and
surrounding areas.

_Ngaˬ Lahu hk'awˇ henˇ chehˇ ve yaꞈ hk'aˇ haˬ jaˆ._

I have moved all my Lahu resources to http://lahu.felixhanley.info Suggestions
and corrections are always welcome.
