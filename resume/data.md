I am a software engineer & architect with a broad range of experience. This
includes the full SDLC process, modern DevOps, and Agile practices.

Over many teams and years of experience in a variety of environments I have
developed a broad range of skills and designed & delivered some high quality
software. I enjoy the "craft" of software development and try to keep abreast
of current research (in more areas than I often need!) and practices,
evaluating them in current projects and teams.

I have been pivotal in the success of many teams, both as a player and lead,
with much experience in training and mentoring, being able to explain technical
topics clearly.

As an Australian I am a native English speaker but am also fluent in Thai.
