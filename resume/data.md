I am a software engineer & architect with experience in a variety of industries
and environments.  This includes the full SDLC process, modern DevOps, and
Agile practices.

My experience covers technical team leadership, consulting, the design and
implementation of large data pipelines, distributed systems, applied
cryptography, API & micro-service design, and most aspects of hosting
infrastructure.

As an Australian I am a native English speaker but am also fluent in Thai.
