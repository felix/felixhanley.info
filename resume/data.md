Software engineer based in Australia.

Over many years of experience in a variety of environments I have developed a
broad range of skills and have designed & delivered numerous high quality
software projects.

I have much experience in training and mentoring, being able to explain
technical topics clearly. I enjoy the "craft" of software engineering and am
interested in helping others get the same satisfaction.

mirrored at [GitHub](https://github.com/felix) and/or
