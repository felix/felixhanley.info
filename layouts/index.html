      <h1>About me</h1>

      <p>I am an Australian with a broad range of experience as a
      software engineer and analyst, both in Australia and South East
      Asia.  I also run <a href="https://userspace.com.au" target="_blank">User Space</a>, a
      Melbourne based programming and bespoke hosting business.</p>

      <p>Over the past 2 decades I have had been involved in the design
      and development of large distributed applications, complex
      networks spanning multiple continents, resilient database clusters
      and custom encryption software in a variety of languages and
      environments.</p>

      <p>I prefer working remotely and have done so for the last 10
      years from the major cities of Australia's east coast, the deserts
      of Western Australia and now both the north and south of
      Thailand.</p>

      <p>I call Melbourne, Australia my home with my wife, son and
      daughter.</p>

      <p>I am available for hire, <a href="/contact/">contact me</a>.</p>
